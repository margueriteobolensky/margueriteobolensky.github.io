This paper examines the relationship between climate similarity and migration, and documents new evidence of climate matching across time, geography, and migrant groups. First, using historical Censuses, we show that European immigrants during the Age of Mass Migration (1850-1920) selected destinations in the US with similar climates to their home country. Second, we link US and Norwegian Censuses, and document the existence of climate matching within countries. That is, immigrants from colder and wetter parts of Norway settled in colder and wetter parts of the US. Third, we find that climate similarity predicts internal migration within the US, both historically (1860-1940) and today (2011-2019). We explore at least two complementary mechanisms that can explain these patterns: climate-specific human capital and climate as amenity. Then, we exploit spatial and temporal variation generated by the 1862 Homestead Act, which offered free land to settlers, to estimate the marginal value of climate. We conclude by discussing the implications for the growing literature on climate change and migration.

The rise in political polarization over the recent years has fostered scrutiny of the structure of the news industry’ s influence on political outcomes. How should policymakers regulate news producers when they value news diversity and large publishers shape the ideological landscape? To answer this question, we develop an empirical model of competition for readership and advertisers between news producers. We recover the topic content and ideological positions of 200 major U.S. daily newspapers using recent advances in Natural Language Processing on millions of published articles. We find that over the period 2007-2017, the median newspaper in our sample got closer to the ideology of the Democratic party. Second, we embed these topics and ideal points in a demand model for differentiated products with heterogeneous readers. Our model shows that rich readers lean democrat and consume more news about social and political questions while the elderly are more conservative and care more about local news. Using the estimated demand model and data on advertising contracts and readership, we can recover the cost of producing each type of content. Given this model of news supply, we intend to use our framework to provide recommendations on antitrust rules weighing both consumer welfare and ideological diversity.
