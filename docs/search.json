Using historical censuses and administrative data, we document several novel findings. First, we show that climate strongly predicts the spatial distribution of international and domestic migrants in the US, both historically (1850-1940) and more recently (2011-2019), whereby movers select destinations with climates similar to those in their origin. Second, we analyze historical flows of German, Norwegian, and domestic migrants in the US and find that climate sorting also holds countries. Third, we exploit variation in the long-run in average US climate from 1900 to 2019 and find evidence of climate matching over time, with migration increasing between locations whose climate converged. Our results hold across time, geography, and migrant groups, and are not driven by the persistence of ethnic networks or other confounders. We provide evidence for two complementary mechanisms: climate-specific human capital and climate as amenity. We then back out the marginal value of climate by: \\(i)\\) exploiting the 1862 Homestead Act, a public policy that changed relative land prices; and, \\(ii)\\) estimating the effect of climate mismatch on life expectancy. We conclude by projecting how climate change can reshape the geography of US internal migration throughout the 21st century.\n\n\nWorks in Progress\nResilient Agriculture: a Dynamic Land Use Approach to Insurance Design in a Changing\nClimate\nLocal Crop Species Diversity and Pest Diffusion: Evidence from the US Census of Agriculture  with Tristan du Puy\n\nNews Media Concentration and Content Diversity  with Pierre Bodéré and\nNicolas Longuet Marx\n\nAbstract\n\n\nThe rise in political polarization over the recent years has fostered scrutiny of the structure of the news industry’ s influence on political outcomes. How should policymakers regulate news producers when they value news diversity and large publishers shape the ideological landscape? To answer this question, we develop an empirical model of competition for readership and advertisers between news producers. We recover the topic content and ideological positions of 200 major U.S. daily newspapers using recent advances in Natural Language Processing on millions of published articles. We find that over the period 2007-2017, the median newspaper in our sample got closer to the ideology of the Democratic party. Second, we embed these topics and ideal points in a demand model for differentiated products with heterogeneous readers. Our model shows that rich readers lean democrat and consume more news about social and political questions while the elderly are more conservative and care more about local news. Using the estimated demand model and data on advertising contracts and readership, we can recover the cost of producing each type of content. Given this model of news supply, we intend to use our framework to provide recommendations on antitrust rules weighing both consumer welfare and ideological diversity.\n\n\nPre-Doctoral Work\nWading Out the Storm: The Role of Poverty in Exposure, Vulnerability and Resilience to Floods in Dar Es Salaam  with Alvina Erman, Mersedeh Tariverdi, Xiaomeng Chen, Rose Vincent, Silvia Malgioglio, Jun Rentschler, Stéphane Hallegatte, Nobuo Yoshida World Bank Policy Research Working Paper No. 8976, 2019\nCandle in the Wind?
