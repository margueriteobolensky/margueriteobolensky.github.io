How should policymakers regulate news producers when they\nvalue news diversity and large publishers shape the ideological\nlandscape? To answer this question, we develop an empirical model of\ncompetition for readership and advertisers between news producers. We\nrecover the topic content and ideological positions of 200 major U.S.\ndaily newspapers using recent advances in Natural Language Processing on\nmillions of published articles. We find that over the period 2007-2017,\nthe median newspaper in our sample got closer to the ideology of the\nDemocratic party. Second, we embed these topics and ideal points in a\ndemand model for differentiated products with heterogeneous readers. Our\nmodel shows that rich readers lean democrat and consume more news about\nsocial and political questions while the elderly are more conservative\nand care more about local news. Using the estimated demand model and\ndata on advertising contracts and readership, we can recover the cost of\nproducing each type of content. Given this model of news supply, we\nintend to use our framework to provide recommendations on antitrust\nrules weighing both consumer welfare and ideological diversity.\n\nIndustry Specialization and Regional Adaptation to\nClimate Change\n\nPre-Doctoral Work\nWading\nOut the Storm: The Role of Poverty in Exposure, Vulnerability and\nResilience to Floods in Dar Es Salaam  with Alvina Erman,\nMersedeh Tariverdi, Xiaomeng Chen, Rose Vincent, Silvia Malgioglio, Jun\nRentschler, Stéphane Hallegatte, Nobuo Yoshida World Bank\nPolicy Research Working Paper No. 8976, 2019\nCandle\nin the Wind?
