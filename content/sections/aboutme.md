Welcome! I am a PostDoctoral Fellow at Northwestern Kellogg School of Management. 

I work on questions in environmental and climate economics using tools from empirical IO. 

I received my PhD in [Sustainable Development](https://www.sipa.columbia.edu/academics/programs/phd-sustainable-development) from Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs. In July 2026, I will be joining UCL as an Lecturer (Assistant Professor) of Economics.
