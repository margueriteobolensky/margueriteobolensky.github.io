Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in the [Sustainable Development program](https://www.sipa.columbia.edu/academics/programs/phd-sustainable-development) at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs. 



I work on questions in environmental economics and climate change adaptation using tools from empirical industrial organization. \

I will join Northwestern Kellogg School of Management as a PostDoctoral Fellow in Summer 2025. Following this, in Summer 2026, I will join UCL as an Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Economics.
