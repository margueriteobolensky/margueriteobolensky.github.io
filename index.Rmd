## Bio 

I am a PhD candidate in Sustainable Development at Columbia University in the City of New York. 

My research interests lie at the intersection of empirical industrial organization environmental economics and political economy. 

I hold a Master in Environmental Economics and Climate Change from the London School of Economics and a Bachelor degree from Ecole Polytechnique, France. Prior to my PhD, I worked as a consultant in disaster risk management at the World Bank.
