Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in the [Sustainable Development program](https://www.sipa.columbia.edu/academics/programs/phd-sustainable-development) at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs. 



I work on questions in environmental economics and climate change adaptation using tools from empirical industrial organization. \

In July 2026, I will be joining UCL as an Lecturer (Assistant Professor) of Economics, following a one-year postdoc at Northwestern Kellogg School of Management.
